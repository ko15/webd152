            <h3>About the team</h3>
            <p>Pacific Trails Resort started with a group of friends who wanted to help others reconnect with nature. They believed that people should not have to sacrifice comfort to immerse themselves in the great outdoors. Since then, we’ve attracted a team of enthusiastic nature lovers and thousands of happy campers. Our “family” here at Pacific Trails are experienced resort staff and wilderness experts excited to share their knowledge with you and show you the beauty of the North Coast.</p>
