    <p>Sanpellegrino Limonata italian sparkling drink: 9/10 stars<br>
        Has a strong lemon flavor, sour without being overly so.<br> 
        Closer to a soda than a sparkling water but has a more distinct<br>
        flavor than other citrus sodas. Especially refreshing when <br>
        refrigerated beforehand. Loses points for being both expensive<br>
        and sold only in small quantities.</p>
